## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do

## Creates a matrix object which caches the inverse of itself.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  
}


## Implements the inverse of the matrix for the object created with the previous
#  function. If the inverse was previously calculated and cached it will return
#  the cached inverse otherwise it will calculate and return the inverse.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
